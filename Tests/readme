This directory contains special version of tesselation code and other things for calculating flux through various patches
on CMB for snapshots of field models

Currents status (07/22)

0) zoner.f90 produces core points, partitioned according to input (flagged -1, 1), output in xyz and latlon forms > tessel, llTessel

1) shtostt doesn't properly evaluate the field at these points for any model




______________________________________________

General strategy is

(0) Use newzoner to produce core points for tesselation and partition them into 2 regions, with flag of 1,-1 according to
whether inside or outside bounding box. Input is specified in zonin. 
>> newzoner <zonin  Default for output is  the file tessel.
(1) Convert unit vectors in tesselation to lat, long, core radius;
(2) Feed to field evlautor along with snapshot sh model to evaluate br on cmb, with region definiton
this is done by 
>> shtostt <shtostt_run


(3) Feed to eflux to calculate flux or whatever through specified regions on CMB or (r=a?)
(4) repeat (2)-(3) for all epochs and add output to summary file

What size tesselation? Use pdeg5 for CALS3k.3





chance progress:

Translated shtostt into .f90
translated and checked zoner

zoner makes model points > tessel (lat, long, rad, iflag)
Shtostt evaluates sh model at tessel points on CMB > file (stt, br, ipp(indexing info?))
eflux evaluates flux integrals through stt-defined null-flux patches on the core

now we need to make a stttosh 
and compare the new sh model with the original sh input to make sure that they are reasonably similar
