This directory contains special version of tesselation code and other things for calculating flux through various patches
on CMB for snapshots of field models

General strategy is

(0) Use newzoner to produce core points for tesselation and partition them into 2 regions, with flag of 1,-1 according to
whether inside or outside bounding box. Input is specified in zonin. 
>> newzoner <zonin  Default for output is  the file tessel.
(1) Convert unit vectors in tesselation to lat, long, core radius;
(2) Feed to field evlautor along with snapshot sh model to evaluate br on cmb, with region definiton
this is done by 
>> shtostt <shtostt_run


(3) Feed to eflux to calculate flux or whatever through specified regions on CMB or (r=a?)
(4) repeat (2)-(3) for all epochs and add output to summary file

What size tesselation? Use pdeg5 for CALS3k.3
