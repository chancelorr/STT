0) zoner.f90 produces core points, partitioned according to input region (flagged -1, 1)
    input: desired region
    output: (x, y, z, flag) and (lat, long, flag)
        named for degree (d) specification - d##, lld##
        stored in pts

1) shtostt evaluates the field from an sh model
    input: model choice
        core point model
        whether to read one or many snapshots
            Snapshot time or time increment
    output file: x, y, z, br, flag, epoch
            stored in stt
        snapshot: m(model)d(degrees)p/n(time)
            here p/n denotes positive or negative time
        many snapshots: m(model)d(degrees)i(increment)
    output model: lmax, nmax, nspl, g
            stored in sh
        snapshot: SH ''
        many snapshots: SH ''
